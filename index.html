        <p>Yaya Urassaya Sperbund, the half Thai/Norwegian actress is the hottest breaking star 
          at the moment. She entered the industry in 2008 but it wasn't until 2010 where she 
          gained immense popularity and created a name for herself with her portrayal of the 
          fearless, daring Jeed in Duang Jai Akkanee (4 Huajai Haeng Koon Kao). Her acting 
          and pairing with co-star Nadech Kugimiya captured the hearts of so many fans across 
          the country where the two are now the most popular "koo kwan" of this generation. 
          Before, Yaya could only speak 30% of the Thai language because she attended 
          international school since childhood where most of her friends were American.
          After being discovered by Pa Tue and signing a contract with Channel 3, Yaya 
          motivated herself to learn the language until she was proficient. 
          And along with the help of a special tutor, she became fluent.</p>

         those targeted by the Khmer Rouge because of their wealth, ethnicity and socio-economic
         status. The entire family was sent to a labour camp where, upon arrival,
